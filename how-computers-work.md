# How computers Work video info

Computers manipulate information by

take input

store the result

process that result

output that result

Algorithm: A series of commands

Bit: The smallest piece of information a computer can store, made up of a binary on off answer

Binary number system: Positions go up by a multiple of 2 each time. The first position is 1, then 2, then 4, then 8 and so on

with 8 wires on a computer using binary, you can store 3 number places up to the number 255

text, images, sounds, etc can also be represented by numbers

A **Not** circuit is one that flips the signal

an **And** circuit only gives out a 1 if both inputs are also 1
