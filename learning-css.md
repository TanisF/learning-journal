# Learning CSS

CSS associates style rules with HTML elements

CSS rules are made up of 2 parts:

Selector: the *element* affected

Declaration: **how** the element is affected

CSS Declarations are inside curly brackets and has 2 parts separated by a colon

Property: What you want to change about the element such as font, color, etc

Value: Specifies what you are changing your property to such as Arial for font, or yellow for color

Multiple properties can be placed within a single declaration by separating each property value combination with a semi-colon

An HTML document that uses CSS should have an external link to a CSS file

Use the link element in HTML to find the CSS file

The link element is an empty element meaning it does not need a closing tag.

Also, it is placed inside the head element and has 3 attributes

href: specifies path to CSS file

type: specifies type of document to be linked. the value should always be text/css

rel: specifies the relationship between file and the HTML page and value should be stylesheet

HTML pages can use multiple CSS style sheets each with its own link element
