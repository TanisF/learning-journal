# Learning Markdown

And my journey begins here...

Important points for _**Markdown**_

1. Allows word formatting for documents on the web
1. The files ending in .md or .markdown are written in Markdown
1. Besides basic text changes like **Bold** or *Italics* you can also add links to websites, add images, create a quotation section, among others
1. Github itself uses something called *Github Flavored Markdown* which adds additional features

[**This Link**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) lists key basic writing and formatting syntax for use with Markdown

Several other links for more advanced materials include

Daring Fireball [**here**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which includes a more complete overview of Markdown as well as a list of syntax

And another about advanced formatting for tables, codeblocks and URLs is hosted by github [**here**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting)
