Hello, My name is **Jordan Fox**

*Growth mindset* to me means that a person is willing to embrace change even though that may feel extremely uncomfortable.

It also means that they are willing to critically self-evaluate both their experience and performance in an honest way. Again, this can be extremely uncomfortable.

Failure is often the best teacher, and a person with a growth mindset accepts that failure is an important part of learning and moving forward towards their goals.

**I AM INTENIONALLY KEEPING THE BELOW FOR NOW...**


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TanisF/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TanisF/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
