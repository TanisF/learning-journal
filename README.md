Hello, My name is **Jordan Fox**

_**Growth mindset**_ to me means that a person is willing to embrace change even though that may feel extremely uncomfortable.

It also means that they are willing to _critically self-evaluate_ both their experience and performance in an honest way. Again, this can be extremely uncomfortable.

_Failure_ is often the best teacher, and a person with a growth mindset accepts that failure is an important part of learning and moving forward towards their goals.

3 ways I intend to help stay in Growth Mindset are

1. Try and accept failure as not a negative

1. Be open to self and other peoples critiques

1. Accept that I will feel uncomfortable at times and that is ok
